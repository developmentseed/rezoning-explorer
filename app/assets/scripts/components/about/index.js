                The Renewable Energy Zoning (REZoning) tool is an interactive,
                web-based platform designed to identify, visualize, and rank zones
                that are most suitable for the development of solar, wind, or
                offshore wind projects. Custom spatial filters and economic
                parameters can be applied to meet users needs or to represent a
                specific country context.

                and developed by ESMAP in partnership with UCSB, the tool
                brings together spatial analysis and economic calculations into an
                online, user-friendly environment that allows users and decision
                makers to obtain insights into the technical and economic

              <p>
                The REZoning tool is powered by global geospatial datasets and
                uses baseline industry assumptions as default values for economic
                calculations. No input dataset, nor simulation outcome produced by
                the tool represents the official position of the World Bank Group
                or UCSB. The boundaries, colors, denominations and other
                information shown on the outputs do not imply on the part of the
                World Bank any judgement on the legal status of any territory or
                endorsement or acceptance of such boundaries. A list of the input
                datasets can be found here (link to ED.info datasets) and the
                methodology is described here (link to github).

              <h2>User Flow</h2>
              <p>
                The user first chooses the country and the resource – solar PV,
                wind, or offshore wind. The user is then presented with options
                for the spatial resolution of the analysis – grid of a specific
                resolution or the sub-national boundaries of the chosen country.
                The spatial analysis consists of three steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Technical Potential:</strong> This step estimates the technical
                  potential or the capacity of a technology available for
                  development by filtering on topographic limitations, land-use
                  constraints, and system performance. The technical potential
                  assessment enables the initial identification of study areas
                  that are technically capable of supporting high-quality RE
                  resource development. A range of options are available in the
                  “FILTERS” tab that users can adjust to reflect different land
                  management scenarios for sitting renewable energy projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Economic Potential:</strong> The users can also choose to use the
                  default values for the input parameters to estimate the LCOE of
                  the resulting zones from step 1. Many of the default values were
                  compiled and provided by the International Renewable Energy
                  Agency (IRENA) using their renewable energy cost database. These
                  are median values of a range of estimates from existing projects
                  by country or region. Because renewable energy project costs are
                  evolving rapidly and actual costs depend on various
                  on-the-ground, region-specific factors that are not captured in
                  this economic model, these values serve only as a reference and
                  may not reflect the real-world project cost potential,
                  especially in regions of the world where few projects have been
                  developed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Multi-criteria analysis and prioritization:</strong> This step allows
                  the user to include various criteria and factors (both monetized
                  and non-monetized) in addition to the LCOE to select and
                  prioritize suitable renewable energy sites for development. Such
                  criteria include slope, population density, [add some more
                  examples]. The user can then provide different weights for each
                  of their criteria under the ‘Weights Tab’ in order to estimate a
                  weighted score for each renewable energy zone. The zones are
                  then sorted and ranked by their scores or LCOE and the user can
                  then identify the zones with the highest scores or lowest LCOE.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h2>Outputs</h2>
              <p>
                At the end of the three steps, the user can use the middle pane to
                visualize and explore the result using the satellite base map but
                also add additional contextual layers, such as roads, grid,
                location of airports, etc. in order to create a meaningful visual
                output. The final map can be printed in .PDF or .PNG format.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, users can download the results of the analysis in
                .CSV, .SHP (for boundaries selection) or GeoTIFF format (for grid
                selection) for further processing in a different environment.
